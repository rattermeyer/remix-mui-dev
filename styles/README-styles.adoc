== Styles Directory

This directory contains the scss source files.
The source files are compiled into the `app/styles` directory at the build phase.

It uses https://github.com/sass/node-sass[Node-Sass] to compile the scss files.

You need to run in dev `npm run dev:css`.
This will compile and watch the scss files for changes.

For production, you need to run `npm run build:css`.
